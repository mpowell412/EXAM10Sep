If suddenly she rears    
pulls, pitches     
into the lightning    
    
if the split sky strikes    
splinters the glassy ground    
(her stride is a circle growing smaller)    
    
when she sees the stars    
â€”all skies have storms    
and she has seen them    
    
if she shies and starts    
when she skids    
when she lowers her eyes    
if she stops to listen:    
    
nervous rider, beware.
